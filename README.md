# Money Keeper
HTML + CSS + SASS + JavaScript

High-level monthly personal/family budget calculator with indication what is your potential additional income in case you invest a remainder at 'conditionally zero-risk' interest rate.

This is a study project to practice basic JavaScript functions and methods - cycles, conditions, dataset, array methods, RegExp, keyboard and mouse events. User amount entry fields are being validated, text fields don't. No libraries used.

Styles include CSS variables for colors and CSS mixins for input fields and buttons. Savings and additional income fields become active or inactive (by adding classes dynamically) depending on checkbox status. SASS is used as a CSS preprocessor.

## How to use?
1. Enter your monthly main income.
